`C#` `ManagementSystem` `SQL Server` 
# GraduationSystem

Undergraduate graduation project, management system written in C#+SQL server,
but it should be changed and can be made into other things, 
and it is also okay to deal with some homework or design homework.

本科毕业设计，C#+SQL server 写的管理系统，不过应该改改还可以做成其他的，应付一下有些作业或者设计作业也还可以。


The first time I wrote a simple and complete project, it was pretty good, 
and some training courses took this directly as classroom content,
but the first time I realized it by myself, it was quite fulfilling.

第一次写的简单完整的项目，挺菜的，一些培训班都把这个直接当作课堂内容讲了，不过第一次自己一个人实现还是挺有成就感。



### tips
There are too many names in it, and sometimes it is replaced with Chinese Pinyin, but not many, 
it can still be understood, but it just takes some time.

里面命名太多了，所有有时候会用汉语拼音代替，不过不是很多，还是可以看得懂的，不过只是需要花一些时间。

I think of extra tips and then add in
额外的tips想到了再加
